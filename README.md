ğŸš€ CNN-Based Digit Recognition Model (MNIST)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model achieves high accuracy on MNIST but may not generalize well to external images due to differences in data distribution.

ğŸ›  Features:
âœ… Trained on the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits 0-9)
âœ… Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification
âœ… High accuracy on MNIST test data
âœ… Built with TensorFlow/Keras & Python


ğŸ“‚ Dataset Details (MNIST)
ğŸ“Œ Dataset Name: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)
ğŸ“Œ Source: Yann LeCunâ€™s MNIST Database
ğŸ“Œ Size: 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels)
ğŸ“Œ Train/Test Split:

Training Set: 60,000 images
Test Set: 10,000 images
ğŸ“Œ Classes: Digits (0-9)


âš  Limitations:
âš  Performs well on MNIST but may struggle with real-world handwritten images
âš  Model needs further fine-tuning for custom datasets

ğŸ“Œ Future Improvements:
->Data Augmentation for better generalization
->Training on additional handwritten digit datasets
->Transfer learning for real-world applications
